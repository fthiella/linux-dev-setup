# linux-dev-setup

This is a collection of scripts that I use to set
up my Oracle Linux 8 workstation for developing
pourposes (text mode only).

The following modules will be installed:

- NGINX with PHP support
- MariaDB
- Postgresql
- Sqlite
- Perl
- Python with Pandas and Matplotlib
- Adminer
- a simple scheduled backup script for MariaDB and Postgresql

Basic configuration (firewall, services, password, ...) for most modules is included. Please don't use it in a production machine!
